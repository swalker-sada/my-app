#### To run this app you need have yarn and node installed in your computer
   **this is only if you are going to run in it in your local computer, otherwise you should be fine**
   - Here are the links to that
       * node: https://nodejs.org/en/
       * yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable

    2. Make sure you are in the right directory or else the app wont run. In my case its
    
 ```terminal
 swalker@sada-hq-macpro186 my-app %
 ```

    3. Once in the project directory run:

### `yarn start`
 once you run that command it should take a minute or two for it to setup. If nothing happens click on the 
 link below and that will take you to the right page

This Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
